	<h1>Performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) on job descriptions using SpaCy</h1>
	
	<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text. In this tutorial, we will use SpaCy, a popular Python library for NLP, to perform NER on job descriptions.</p>
	
	<h2>Steps:</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Install SpaCy</li>
		<li>Load the job descriptions</li>
		<li>Preprocess the text</li>
		<li>Perform NER with SpaCy</li>
		<li>Visualize the results</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>By following these steps, you will be able to extract important information from job descriptions, such as the names of companies, job titles, and required skills.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	
	<p>In this tutorial, we learned how to perform Named Entity Recognition on job descriptions using SpaCy. With this knowledge, you can extract valuable information from large datasets of job postings, which can be used to gain insights into the job market and help job seekers find the right opportunities.</p>
