The project requires the use of Jupyter notebook and Python programming language. The following libraries are necessary for the successful implementation of the project:

1. **pandas**: for data loading and manipulation <br>
2. **numpy**: for numerical computing <br>
3. **spacy**: for natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing <br>
4. **nltk**: for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization <br>
5. **plotly**.express: for data visualization and exploration <br>
6. **matplotlib**: for data visualization <br>
7. **spacy.displacy**: for visualizing spacy's dependency trees and named entity recognition results <br>

The tutorial have clear documentation on how to install and use these libraries. The code is well-commented and organized using Jupyter notebooks. <br>
